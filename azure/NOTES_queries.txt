Query 36: using the lochierarchy attribute generated in the projection for the order by clause
generates an error. It may be necessary to use the alternative.

Query 41: uses top and distinct at the same time, so the generated form needs to be modified to be
like

select distinct top 100 i_product_name

Query 70: same issue as with query 36.

Query 86: same issue as with query 36


Schema:

For the table item, the i_category attribute cannot be used for order because it is a string,
so use i_category_id instead.

Query 14 fix:

Change the line below to the line below that

select top 100 channel, i_brand_id,i_class_id,i_category_id,sum(sales), sum(number_sales)
select top 100 channel, i_brand_id,i_class_id,i_category_id,sum(cast(sales as bigint)), sum(cast(number_sales as bigint))     

Find: ss_quantity*ss_list_price
Replace with: cast(ss_quantity as bigint)*cast(ss_list_price as bigint)
Find: quantity*list_price
Replace with: cast(quantity as bigint)*cast(list_price as bigint)
Find: cs_quantity*cs_list_price
Replace with: cast(cs_quantity as bigint)*cast(cs_list_price as bigint)
Find: ws_quantity*ws_list_price
Replace with: cast(ws_quantity as bigint)*cast(ws_list_price as bigint)
