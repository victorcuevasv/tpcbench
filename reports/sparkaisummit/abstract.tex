We present a performance comparison of Databricks with EMR Spark and EMR Presto based on the TPC-DS benchmark.
Several configurations were tested, including the use of table and column statistics as well as dynamic data partitioning.
Our results show that for the best configurations, Databricks is about 32\% faster than EMR Spark, and about 4 times
faster than EMR Presto. Databricks also showed the lowest monetary cost overall. In addition, both Databricks and EMR Spark
required significantly less effort in relation to tuning when compared with EMR Presto.
