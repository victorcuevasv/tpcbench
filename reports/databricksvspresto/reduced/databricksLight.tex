\section{Databricks Light vs. EMR Presto}\label{databricksLight}

In this section, we compare EMR Presto with Databricks Light. Based on the open source Apache Spark framework, Databricks Light offers an alternative to the Databricks Data Engineering runtime; hence, it is also referred to as Data Engineering Light. The price per hour for operating Databricks Light clusters is about half that of Databricks Data Engineering, but it lacks the advanced performance and reliability features of the latter. An additional restriction is that Databricks Light can only be used for job clusters and not for interactive clusters.

Concretely, the experiments in this section use the Light 2.4 runtime instead of the 5.3 runtime of our reference results, both of which employ Spark 2.4 and Scala 2.11.

\subsection{Data loading}

The results of the Data Loading Test appear in Figure \ref{fig:prestoVsDatabricksLightDataLoadingTotalTime}. Databricks Light is about 20\% faster than EMR Presto using the ORC format, and essentially as fast as Databricks Data Engineering. In terms of monetary costs (summarized in Section \ref{resultsSummaryTotalCost}), EMR Presto and Databricks Data Engineering are close to balancing each other, but they are beaten by Databricks Light due to its lower software costs, yielding a cost around 25\% cheaper.

\subsection{Individual query execution (Power Test)}

We present the metrics associated with the Power Test in Figure \ref{fig:prestoVsDatabricksLightPowerTestTotalTime} to Figure \ref{fig:prestoVsDatabricksLightPowerTestArithmeticMean}. Overall, Databricks Light shows a performance about twice as good as EMR Presto.

The comparison of individual queries that we show in Figure \ref{fig:prestoVsDatabricksLightPowerTestIndividualQueries1} to Figure \ref{fig:prestoVsDatabricksLightPowerTestIndividualQueries5} enables to make a more in depth analysis. Databricks Light gives a better performance in 81 queries, while the remaining 18 favor EMR Presto. Among the queries that complete faster in EMR Presto, 12 of them do so by a margin of 25\% or more. In the case of the queries that are faster in Databricks Light, 69 of them are at least 25\% faster. In general, Databricks Light is significantly faster for the vast majority of the queries in the benchmark, while EMR Presto is significantly faster for a relatively small subset.

   \label{fig:prestoVsDatabricksLightPowerTestIndividualQueries5}
\end{figure}

The geometric mean and the arithmetic mean, shown in Figure \ref{fig:prestoVsDatabricksLightPowerTestGeomean} and Figure \ref{fig:prestoVsDatabricksLightPowerTestArithmeticMean}, respectively, confirm that Databricks Light is about 100\% faster than EMR Presto.

\subsection{Concurrent query execution (Throughput Test)}

We provide the results for the Throughput Test in Figure \ref{fig:prestoVsDatabricksLightTputTest}. Databricks Light is almost 2.4 times faster than EMR Presto.

\begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
   \scalebox{0.65}{\includegraphics[width=7.0in]{../imgs/databricksLight/tput_totalHrTimeBarChart.pdf}}
   \end{center}
   \caption{EMR Presto vs. Databricks Light Throughput Test total time.}
   \label{fig:prestoVsDatabricksLightTputTest}
\end{figure}

Again, the performance of Databricks Light is roughly twice that of EMR Presto. Even in total costs, as we show in Section \ref{resultsSummaryTotalCost}, the relation between their performance holds. Given that running a job either on Databricks Light or in Databricks Data Engineering requires minimal configuration changes, it is definitely an advantage to have two alternatives with distinct price-performance profiles; we provide the concrete metrics in Section \ref{resultsSummaryPerformanceMetric}.
