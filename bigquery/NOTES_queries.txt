union does not seem to be supported, but union all does (query 86).


Query 8
Problem: error with intersect.
Solution: add distinct to intersect.
Issues: fivetran rewrites the query instead.

Query 14
Problem: error with intersect.
Solution: add distinct to intersect.
Issues: fivetran rewrites the query instead.

Query 23
Problem: reference to substring expression in GROUP BY.
Solution: change the expression to the number 1 to refer to that expression in the select clause.
Issues: fivetran also uses this approach but also rewrites the query in other ways.

Query 36
Problem: error with union.
Solution: add distinct to union
Issues: fivetran apparently uses the default template that uses rank

Query 38
Problem: error with intersect.
Solution: add distinct to intersect.
Issues: fivetran rewrites the query instead.

Query 49
Problem: error with union.
Solution: add distinct to union
Issues: fivetran uses union all

Query 62
Problem: reference to substring expression in GROUP BY and ORDER BY.
Solution: change the expression to the number 1 to refer to that expression in the select clause.
Issues: fivetran also uses this approach but also rewrites the query in other ways.

Query 70
Problem: error with union.
Solution: add distinct to union
Issues: fivetran uses union all

Query 75
Problem: error with union.
Solution: add distinct to union
Issues: fivetran uses union all

Query 86
Problem: error with union.
Solution: add distinct to union
Issues: fivetran uses original template

Query 87
Problem: error with except.
Solution: add distinct to except
Issues: fivetran rewrites the query using not exists

Query 99
Problem: reference to substring expression in GROUP BY and ORDER BY.
Solution: change the expression to the number 1 to refer to that expression in the select clause.
Issues: fivetran also uses this approach but also with the remaining columns in the group by.


Query 67 had to be implemented as in the fivetran repository due to out of memory errors for both
the original query and its alternative.
